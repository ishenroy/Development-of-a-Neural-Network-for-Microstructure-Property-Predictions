# Development-of-a-Neural-Network-for-Microstructure-Property-Predictions
I develop a neural network that predicts the effective Youngâ€™s modulus (E_eff) from 65x65 pixel binary images of two-phase microstructures. The model achieve less than 30 percent relative error on an unseen test set. No external data or complex augmentation was used.
